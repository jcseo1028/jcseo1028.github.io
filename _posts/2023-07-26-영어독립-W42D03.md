### Remember this expression

```text
See red
(분노하다)
```

My parents saw red when they discovered that I scratched their car while secretly driving it.

When Sandra was humiliated, she saw red.

My sister saw red when she found out that her boyfriend cheated on her.

discover
 : 발견하다.

humiliate
 : 굴욕감을 주다.
