The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing

A wolf was hungry but couldn't get enough to eat because of the shepherds on watch.
One night, he found a sheepskin that had been put aside and forgotten about.
So, the next day, dressed in the skin, the wolf walked in the pasture among the sheep.
A little lamb immediately started following him around and was quickly led away to be eaten by the wolf.
That evening, when the wolf returned, it just so happened that one of the shepherds wanted mutton broth, so he picked up a knife and went to the pasture.
The first sheep he laid his hand on and killed was actually the wolf in the sheepskin.
The evildoer often comes to harm through his own deceit.
