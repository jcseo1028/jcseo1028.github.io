### Devide and conquer

When you are dehydrated,

your mouse gets dry,

and if there is not enough saliva to wipe out the bacteria,

they accumulate and cause bad breath.

dehydrate
 : 탈수 상태가 되다.

I felt dehydrated after a long day out in the hot sun.

saliva
 : 침

bad breath
 : 입 냄새

wipe out
 : 닦아내다, 지우다.
