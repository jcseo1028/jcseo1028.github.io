The Rabbit and the Turtle

One day, a rabbit was making fun of a turtle for being so slow.
"Do you ever get anywhere?" he asked, laughing.
"Yes," replied the turtle, "I get there sooner than you think. I'll race you and prove it."
The rabbit was amused at the idea of racing the turtle, so he agreed to it.
The rabbit quidckly ran for out of sight, and to make the turtle feel ridiculous, he lay down, waiting for the turtle to catch up.
Meanwhile, the turtle kept going slowly but steadily.
After a while, he passed the place where the rabbit was sleeping.
The rabbit continued to sleep very peacefully.
When he finally did wake up, the turtle was already near the finish line.
The rabbit ran as fast as he coule, but he could not catch up to the turtle in time.
The race is not always to the swift.
```

Do you ever get anywhere?

ever
 : (어감상) 과거, 현재, 미래를 망라하는 모든 시간

forever = for + ever
 : 과거, 현재, 미래의 모든 시간 동안 (영원히)

whenever = when + ever
 : 모든 시간 중 언제나 (언제든지)

first-ever = first + ever
 : 모든 시간 중 처음 (생전 처음의)

The race is not always to the swift.

the + 형용사 = ~ 한 사람.

the rich and the poor

swift
 : 재빠른

make fun of
 : ~를 놀리다

out of sight
