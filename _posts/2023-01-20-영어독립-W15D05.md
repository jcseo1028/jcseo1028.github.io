The Fly and The Bull

A fly flew across a meadow and settled on the tip of a bull's horn.
After resting for a short time, he was ready to fly away.
But before he left, he apologized to the bull for using his forn as a place to rest.
"You must be glad I'm leaving," he said.
"It doesn't matter to me," replied the bull.
"I didn't even know you were there."
We are often of greater importance in our own eyes than in the eyes of our neighbor.
