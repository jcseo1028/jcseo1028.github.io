### Power up reading

```
The Frog and the Ox

An ox went down to the water for a drink.
Seeing him splash around, two little frogs ran to their mother.
"A great big monster almost stepped on us!" said one of them.
"Big?" said the mother frog, puffing herself up.
"Was he as big as this?" "Oh, much bigger!" They cried together.
The mother frog puffed herself up more.
"He could not have been bigger than this," she said.
But the little frogs all said that the monster was much bigger.
So, the mother frog kept puffing herself up more and more until her belly burst.
Do not attempt the impossible.
