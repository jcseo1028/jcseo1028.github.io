Belling the Cat

One day, a council of mice convened for an urgent meeting.
The meeting was about their common enemy, the cat.
They lived in such constant fear of her claws that they hardly ever left their homes.
Something had to be done.
They discussed many plans, but none of them were good enough.
Finally, a very young mouse got up and said:
"I have very simple plan. All we have to do is hang the bell around the cat's neck! When we hear the ringging, we'll know that cat is coming."
All the mice celebrated this clever plan.
But then an old mouse stood up and asked:
"Who will put the bell around the cat's neck?"
It is one thing to say that something should be done, but quite a different matter to do it.
```

They hardly ever left their homes.

I could hardly get up this morning.

All we have to do is hang a bell around the cat's neck!

all one has to do is ~
 : ~ 만 하면 된다.

All I have to do is get this beg in the car.

It is one thing to say that something should be done, but quite a different matter to do it.

it is one thing to A, but another thing to B
 : A 와 B 는 별개의 문제이다. (A와 B가 같아 보이지만 다른 것이다.)

It is one thing to memorize something, but another thing to understand it.
