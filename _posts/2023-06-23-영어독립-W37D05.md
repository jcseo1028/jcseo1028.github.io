The Sheep and the Pig

One day, a shepherd discovered a fat pig in the meadow.
He quickly captured the pig, which squealed at the top of its lungs the moment the shepherd laid his hands on it.
The sheep in the meadow were very surprised and amused at the pig's behavior.
"What makes you squeal like that?" asked one of the sheep.
"The shepherd catches and carries one of us off very often, but we'd feel very ashamed making such a terrible fuss about it like you did."
"That's fine," replied the pig.
"When he catches you, he is only after your wool, but he wants my bacon!"
It is easy to be brave when there is no longer.

The sheep in the meadow were very surprised and amused at the pig's behavior.

I'll have to find a way to amuse myself for a few hours while waiting for the plain.

We'd feel very ashamed making such a terrible fuss about it like you did.

I can't believe the teacher told me to come to school just because my son punched another kid.

Well, I would feel very ashamed.
