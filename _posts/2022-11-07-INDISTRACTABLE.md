#### What's Your Superpower?

We need to learn how to avoid distraction.
 : Living the life we want not only requires doing the right things, but also necessitates not doing the things we know we'll regret.

The problem is deeper than tech.
 : Being indistracable isn't about being a Luddite.
   It's about understanding the real reasons why we do things against our best interests.

Here's what it takes
 : We can be indistractable by learning and adopting four key stratergies.

#### Being Indistractable

Distraction stops us from achiving our goals.
 : It is any action that moves you away from what you really want.

Traction leads you closer to your goals.
 : It is any action that moves you towards what you really want.

Trigger prompt both traction and distraction.
 : External triggers prompt you to action with cues in your environment.
   Internal triggers prompt you to action with cues with in you

#### What Motivates Us, Really?

Understand the root cause of distraction.
 : Distraction is about more than your devices.
   Seperate proximate causes from the root cause.

All motivation is a desire to escape discomfort.
 : If a behaviour was previously effective at providing relief, we're likely to continue using it as a tool to escape discomfort.

Anything that stops discomport os potentially addictive, but doesn't make it irresistible.
 : If you know the driver of your behaviour, you can take steps to manage them.

#### Time Management is Pain Management

Time management is pain management.
 : Distractions cost us time, and, like all actions, they are spurred by the desire to escape discomfort.

Evolution favours dissatisfaction over contentment.
 : Our tendencies towards boredom, negative bias, rumination and hedonic adaptation conspire to make sure we're never satisfied for long.

Dissatisfaction is responsible for our species' advancement as much as its faults.
 : It is an innate power that can be channelled to help us make things better.

If we want to master distraction, we must learn to deal with discomfort.
 : How?

#### Deal with Distraction from Within

Without techniques for disarming temptation, mental abstinence can backfire.
 : Resisting an urge can trigger rumination and make the desire grow stronger.

We can manage distractions that originate from within by changing how we think about them.
 : We can reimagine the trigger, the task and our temperament.

#### Reimagine the Internal Trigger

By reimagining an uncomfortable internal trigger, we can disarm it.
 : Step1 - Look for the emotion preceding distraction.
   Step2 - Write down the internal trigger.
   Step3 - Explore the negative sensation with curiosity instead of contempt.
   Step4 - Be extra cautious during liminal moments.

#### Reimagine the Task

We can master internal triggers by reimagining an otherwise dreary task.
 : Fun and play can be used as tools to keep us focused.

Play doesn't have to be pleasurable.
 : It just has to hold our attention.

Deliberateness and novelty can be added to any task to make it fun.
 : ?

#### Reimagine Your Temperament

Reimagining our temperament can help us manage our internal triggers.
 : ?

We don't run out of willpower.
 : Believing we do makes us less likely to accomplish our goals, by providing a rationale to quit when we could otherwise persist.

What we say to ourselves matters.
 : Labelling yourself as having poor self-control is self-defeating.

Practice self-compassion.
 : Talk to yourself the way you'd talk to a friend.
   People who are more self-compassionate are more resilient.
