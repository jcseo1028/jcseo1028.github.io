The Plane Tree

One day, two travelers found a plane tree when walking in the hot afternoon sun.
"Plane trees are useless!", said one of them.
"They don't produce fruit and only litter the ground with leaves."
"Ungrateful creatures!" said a voice from the plane tree.
"You lie here in my shade, cooling down, and stil, you say that I'm useless! People are so ungrateful!"
Our best blessings are often the least appreciated. 
```

Ungrateful cretures!

grateful
 : 감사하는

unhappy
 : 행복하지 않은, 불쌍한

unlucky
 : 운이 좋지 않은, 불운한

undo
 : (묶인 것을) 풀다, 원상태로 되돌린다.

unchanged
 : 바뀌지 않는, 변함없는

Our best blessings are often the least appreciated.

something is often the least appreciated
 : (너무 당연해서) 감사함을 느끼지 못한다.

Even though this part of the process is crucial, it's often the least appreciated.

litter
 : 쓰레기
   버리다, 흐트러져 어지럽히다.
