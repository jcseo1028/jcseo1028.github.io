The Owl and the Grasshopper

One warm summer afternoon, as an old owl dozed away in her den in an old oak tree, a nearby grasshopper began singing a very raspy song.
The wise old owl knew quite well  that it would do no good to argue with the grasshopper.
Besides, her eyes were not sharp enough during the day to catch the grasshopper.
So, she laid aside all harsh words and spoke very kindly to him.
"Well sir," She said, "I am truely enjoying your singing. Now that I think of it, I have some wonderful wine here, Please come up and enjoy this delicious drink with me."
The foolish grasshopper was taken in by the owl's flattering words.
Up he jumped, and as soon as he was close enough for the old owl to see him, she ate him up.
Flattery is not a proof of true admiration.
