The Fox and the Grapes

One day, a fox noticed beautiful ripe grapes hanging from a vine along some tree branches.
The fox's mouth watered as he looked at them.
The grapes hung from a high branch, so the fox had to jump to get them.
He jumped, but he missed by a lot.
He tried over and over again but couldn't reach the grapes.
Finally, he sat down and looked at the grapes in disgust.
"I'm such a fool" he said.
"The sour grapes aren't even worth it."
Many pretend to despise and belittle that which is beyond their reach.
