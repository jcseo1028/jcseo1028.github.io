The Farmer and the Stork

A group of cranes asked a trustworthy stork to visit a new field with them, but things ended badly when all of the birds were captured in a farmer's net.
The stork begged the farmer to spare him.
"Please let me go," he pleaded, "I belong to the stork family who you know are honest, good birds. Besides, I did not know the cranes were going to steal."
"You may a very good bird," answered the farmer, "but I caught you with the thieves, so you will have to get the same punishment as them."
You are judged by the company you keep.
