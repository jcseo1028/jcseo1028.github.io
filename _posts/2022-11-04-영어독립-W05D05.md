The Swallow and the Other Birds

One spring, a farmer was planting hemp seeds in a field where a swallow and some other birds were eating.
"Be ware of that man", said the swallow.
"Why?" asked the others.
"He is planting hemp seeds. Make sure to eat them all, or else you will regret it."
However, the birds didn't listen to the swallow's warning, so the hemp grew and was eventually used to make nets.
Many of the birds that ignored the swallow's warning were caught in the made of hemp.
Destroy the seed of evil, or it will grow up to your ruin.
