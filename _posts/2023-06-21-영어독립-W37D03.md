### Remember this expression

```text
At the risk of
(~의 위험을 무릅쓰고)
```

At the risk of sounding stupid, can I ask what the capital of your country is?

At the risk of catching a cold, I went swimming at the beach in December.

at your own risk
 : 당신의 책임으로

You can gamble at your own risk.

sound stupid
 : 멍청하게 들리다

catch a cold
 : 감기에 걸리다
