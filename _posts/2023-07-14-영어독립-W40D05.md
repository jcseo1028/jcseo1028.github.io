The Wolf and the Lion

One evening, a wolf left his house in a good mood.
As he ran, the setting sun cast his shadow far out on the ground, and it looked like the wolf was a hundred times bigger than he actually was.
"Wow," exclaimed the wolf proudly, "look how big I am! I'll show the lion who is fit to be king!"
Just then, a huge shadow completely covered him, and suddenly, a lion knocked him down with a single blow.
Do not let your fancy make you forget realities.
