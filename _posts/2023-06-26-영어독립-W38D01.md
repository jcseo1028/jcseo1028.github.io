### Read it out loud

```text
Don't add fuel to the fire
(불난 집에 부채질하지 말아라.)
```

The principal's comments added fuel to the fire by making parents more upset.

The government added fuel to the inflatioary fire throught a series of ineffective policies.

infationary
 : 인플레이션에 의한

ineffective
 : 효과 없는, 효과적이지 못한

upset
 : 화난, 불쾌한
