### Remember this expression

```
Too A to B
(B 하기에는 너무 A 하다)
```

I am too weak to run a maraton.

Sarah was too tired to take a shower.

so A that B
 : 너무 A 해서 B 하다.

Sarah was so tired that she fell asleep immediately.

I am so exhausted that I am not sure if I can continue.

fall asleep
 : 잠들다

exhaust
 : 기진맥진하게 만들다, 고갈시키다.
