The Fox and the Leopard

One day, a fox and a leopard were arguing about their looks.
The leopard was very proud of his glossy, spotted coat and made rude comments about the fox.
The fox prided himself on his fine bushy tail, but he was wise enough to see that he could not compare his looks to the leopard.
Still, he was sarcastic and continued to argue just for fun and to show off his wit.
The leopard was about to lose his temper over it.
"You may have a very beautiful coat," the fox said, "but you would be better off if you had more brains than beauty, like me."
A fine coat is not always an indication of an attractive mind.
