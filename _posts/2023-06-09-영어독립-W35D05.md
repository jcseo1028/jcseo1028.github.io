The Oxen and the Wheels

A pair of oxen were pulling a heavy wagon along  a muddy country road.
They had to use all their strength to pull the wagon, but they did not complain.
On the other hand, the wheels on the wagon creaked and groaned at every turn, and when pulling the wagon thorough the deep mud, the poor oxen heard the wheel's loud complaints again.
"Be quiet!" the oxen yelled impatiently.
"What do you wheels have to complain about loudly?
We are pulling all the weight, not you, and we aren't even complaining!"
They complain most who suffer least.
```

The wheels on the wagon creaked and groaned at every turn.

At every turn, I only encountered more and more problems.

They complain most who suffer least.

Those who suffer least complain most,
Those who complain the most are the ones who suffer the least.
