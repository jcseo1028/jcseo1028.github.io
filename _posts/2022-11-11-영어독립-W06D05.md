The Mountains in Labor

One day, the mountains surrounding a village started moving.
Smoke rose from the mountain peaks, the earth was shaking, trees were crashing down, and huge rocks were falling.
The villagers were sure that something horrible was going to happen.
They waited and waited, but nothing happened.
Then suddenly, there was an even stronger earthquake, and a huge crevice formed on the side of the mountains.
The villagers all kneeled and prayed.
Finally, a teeny-tiny mouse poked its little head out.
Seeing the mouse, a villager said:
"Much outcry, little outcome"
```

Finally, a teeny-tiny mouse poked its little head out.

She made a teeny-tiny mistake while painting, but it was so small I could barely see it.

Much outcry, little outcome.

During the storm, there was so much noise but suprisingly very little damage as a result.
