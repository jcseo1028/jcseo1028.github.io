The Heron

A heron was walking along the bank of a stream, looking at the clear water.
His long neck and pointed bill were ready to catch something for breakfast.
The clear water was swarming with fish, but the heron was hard to please.
"No small fish for me." he said.
Then a fine perch swam by.
"No thank you." said the heron.
"I wouldn't even bother opening my beak for something like that!"
As the sun rose, the fish left the shallow water near the shore and swam down to cooler water.
The heron didn't see any more fish, so in the end, he had to settle for having a tiny snail for breakfast.
Do not be too hard to please, or else you may have to be content with the worst or with nothing at all.
