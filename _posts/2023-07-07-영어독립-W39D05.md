The Lion and the Donkey

One day, as a lion walked proudly through the forest, and the animals respectifully made way for him, someone made a rude remark behind him.
The lion felt a flash of anger, but when he turned his head and saw that it was donkey who has spoken, he quietly worked on.
He would not honor the fool with even so much as a stroke of his claws.
Do not resent the remarks of a fool. Ignore them.
