The Rat and the Elephant

One day, a rat was traveling along the King's highway.
As he walked along - he kept mostly to the ditch - he noticed a big commotion up the road.
It was the King and his advisors.
The King rode on a huge elephant adorned with the most gorgeous jewels.
The royal dog and cat were also present with the King.
A large crowd of people followed the procession.
Everyone admired the elephant, but the rat went unnoticed.
"What fools!" he cried.
"Look at me! Is it his great size that makes your eyes pop out? I have eyes and ears and as many legs as him! I'm just as important, and"
But just then, the royal cat noticed him, and in the next instant, the rat knew he was not as important as an elephant.
A resemblance to the great in some things does not make us great.
