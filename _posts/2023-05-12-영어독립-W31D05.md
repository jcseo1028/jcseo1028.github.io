The Young Crab and His Mother

"Why in the world do you walk sideways like that?" a mother crab asked her son.
"You should always walk straight forward."
"Show me to walk, mother," answered the little crab obediently, "I want to learn."
So the old crab tried and tried to walk straight forward, but she could walk sideways only, like her son.
And when she tried to turn her toes out, she tripped and fell on her rose.
Do not tell others how to act unless you can't set a good example.

"Why in the world do you walk sideways like that?"

Who in the world is that?
When in the world will you stop?
Where in the world were you?
What in the world is that?
How in the world did you do that?
Why in the world did you do that?

Do not tell others how to act unless you can set a good example.

You can't go out to play unless you've finished your homework. Set an example for your siblings.
