### Devide and conquer

Values need to be

freely chosen and

in line with internal standards

rather than external expectations placed on us by others.

The problem needs to be taken seriously rather than laughed at like a joke.

internal
 : 내적인, 내부의

external
 : 외적인, 외부의

in line with
 : ~와 일치하다, 부합하다

values
 : 가치관
