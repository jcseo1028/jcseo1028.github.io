The Frog and the Mouse

One day, an adventurous mouse met a frog at a pond.
The frog said to the mouse, "Why don't you visit my home?"
The mouse really wanted to see the world and everything in it.
So, He happily agreed.
The frog used a reed to tie the mouse's leg to his own.
Then, they both jumped into the pond, and the frog dragged the mouse with him.
Soon, the mouse couldn't breathe and tried to swim up, but the frog got angry thinking the mouse wasn't greatful.
He continued to pull the mouse down under the water and drowned him.
Then, the dead body of the mouse pulled the tired frog upward.
And at that moment, a hawk came flying over.
Seeing the body of the mouse floating on the water, the hawk swooped down, grabbed the mouse, and carried it off with the frog dangling from its leg.
Those who harm others often come to harm themselves through their own deceit.
