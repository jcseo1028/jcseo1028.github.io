The Fisherman and the Little Fish

A poor fisherman, who lived on the fish he caught, had bad luck one day and caught nothing but one very small fish.
The fisherman was about to put it in his basket when the little fish said:
"Please spare me, Mr. Fisherman! I am so small that I'm not even worth eating. When I am bigger, I'll make a much better meal."
But the fisherman quickly put the fish into his basket.
"It'd be so foolish of me to throw you back." he said.
"Even if you're small, you're better than nothing."
A small gain is worth more than a large promise.
