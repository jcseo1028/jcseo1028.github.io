The Wolf and the Donkey

A donkey was feeding in a pasture near the woods when he saw a wolf lurking in the shadows along the hedge.
The donkey was clever, so he pretended he was lame and began to hobble as if in pain.
The wolf slowly came up and asked what was going on.
"Please pull it out," the donkey pleaded and groaned.
"I stepped on a thorn. I you do not help me pull it out, it might stick in your throat when you eat me."
The wolf saw the wisdom of the advise.
So, the donkey lifted up his foot and the wolf began to search very closely and carefully for the thorn.
Just then, the donkey kicked the wolf in the face and galloped away to safety.
"Serves me right," growled the wolf.
"I'm a butcher by trade, not a doctor."
Stick to your trade.
```

"Serves me right."
 : 꼴 좋구만.

It serves me right for thinking I could easily win first place.

Stick to your trade.

There were a lot of mistakes in your work. Next time, just stick to your trade.
