 : to reverse-engineer

#### What's Your Superpower?

We need to learn how to avoid distraction.
 : Living the life we want not only requires doing the right things, but also necessitates not doing the things we know we'll regret.

The problem is deeper than tech.
 : Being indistracable isn't about being a Luddite.
   It's about understanding the real reasons why we do things against our best interests.

Here's what it takes
 : We can be indistractable by learning and adopting four key stratergies.

#### Being Indistractable

Distraction stops us from achiving our goals.
 : It is any action that moves you away from what you really want.

Traction leads you closer to your goals.
 : It is any action that moves you towards what you really want.

Trigger prompt both traction and distraction.
 : External triggers prompt you to action with cues in your environment.
   Internal triggers prompt you to action with cues with in you

#### What Motivates Us, Really?

Understand the root cause of distraction.
 : Distraction is about more than your devices.
   Seperate proximate causes from the root cause.

All motivation is a desire to escape discomfort.
 : If a behaviour was previously effective at providing relief, we're likely to continue using it as a tool to escape discomfort.

Anything that stops discomport os potentially addictive, but doesn't make it irresistible.
 : If you know the driver of your behaviour, you can take steps to manage them.

#### Time Management is Pain Management

Time management is pain management.
 : Distractions cost us time, and, like all actions, they are spurred by the desire to escape discomfort.

Evolution favours dissatisfaction over contentment.
 : Our tendencies towards boredom, negative bias, rumination and hedonic adaptation conspire to make sure we're never satisfied for long.

Dissatisfaction is responsible for our species' advancement as much as its faults.
 : It is an innate power that can be channelled to help us make things better.

If we want to master distraction, we must learn to deal with discomfort.
 : -

#### Deal with Distraction from Within

Without techniques for disarming temptation, mental abstinence can backfire.
 : Resisting an urge can trigger rumination and make the desire grow stronger.

We can manage distractions that originate from within by changing how we think about them.
 : We can reimagine the trigger, the task and our temperament.

#### Reimagine the Internal Trigger

By reimagining an uncomfortable internal trigger, we can disarm it.
 : Step1 - Look for the emotion preceding distraction.
   Step2 - Write down the internal trigger.
   Step3 - Explore the negative sensation with curiosity instead of contempt.
   Step4 - Be extra cautious during liminal moments.

#### Reimagine the Task

We can master internal triggers by reimagining an otherwise dreary task.
 : Fun and play can be used as tools to keep us focused.

Play doesn't have to be pleasurable.
 : It just has to hold our attention.

Deliberateness and novelty can be added to any task to make it fun.
 : -

#### Reimagine Your Temperament

Reimagining our temperament can help us manage our internal triggers.
 : -

We don't run out of willpower.
 : Believing we do makes us less likely to accomplish our goals, by providing a rationale to quit when we could otherwise persist.

What we say to ourselves matters.
 : Labelling yourself as having poor self-control is self-defeating.

Practice self-compassion.
 : Talk to yourself the way you'd talk to a friend.
   People who are more self-compassionate are more resilient.

#### Turn Your Values into Time

You can't call something a distraction unless you know what it is distracting you from.
 : Planning ahead is the only way to know the difference between traction and distraction.

Does your calendar reflect your values?
 : To be the person you want to be, you have to make time to live your values.

Timebox your day.
 : The three life domains of you, relationships and work provide a framework for planning how to spend your time.

Reflect and refine
 : Revise your schedule regularly, but you must commit to it once it's set.

#### Control the Inputs, Not the Outcomes

Schedule time for yourself first.
 : You are at the centre of the three life domains.
   By not allocating time for yourself, the other two domains suffer.

Show up when you say you will.
 : You can't always control what you get out of time you spend, but you can control how much time you put into a task.

Input is much more certain than outcome.
 : When it comes to living the life you want, making sure you allocate time to living your values is the only thing you should focus on.

#### Schedule Important Relationships

The people you love deserve more than getting whatever time is left over.
 : If someone is important to you, make regular time for them on your calendar.

Go beyond scheduling date days with your significant other.
 : Put domestic chores on your calendar to ensure an equitable split.

A lack of close friendships may be hazardous to your health.
 : Ensure you maintain important relationships by scheduling time for regular get-togethers.

#### Sync with Stakeholders at Work

Syncing your schedule with stakeholders at work is critical for making time for traction in your day.
 : Without visibility of how you spend your time, colleagues and managers are more likely to distract you with superfluous tasks.

Sync as frequently as your changes.
 : If your schedule template changes from day to day, have a daily check-in.
   However, most people find a weekly alignment is sufficient.

#### Ask the Critical Question

External triggers often lead to distraction.
 : Cues in our environment like the pings, dings, rings from devices, as well as interruptions from other people, frequently take us off-track.

External triggers aren't always harmful.
 : If an external trigger leads us to traction, it serves us.

We must ask: is this trigger serving me, or am I serving it?
 : Then, we can hack back the external triggers that don't serve us.

#### Hack Back Work Interruptions

Interruptions lead to mistakes.
 : You can't do your best work if you're frequently distracted.

Open-office floor plans increase distraction.
 : -

Defend your focus.
 : Signal when you do not want to be interrupted.
   Use a screen sign or some other clear cue to let people know you are indistractable.

#### Hack Back Email

Break down the problem.
 : Time spent on email (T) is a function of the number of messages received (n) multiplied by the average time (t) spent per message.
   T = n x t

Reduce the number of messages received.
 : Schedule office hours, delay when each messages are send, and reduce the number of time-wasting messages reching your inbox.

Spend less time on each message.
 : Label emails according to when each message needs a reponse.
   Reply to emails during a scheduled time in your calendar.

#### Hack Back Group Chat

Real=time communication channels should be used sparingly.
 : Time spent communicating should not come at the cost of time spent concentrating.

Company culture matters.
 : Changing group chat practices may involve questioning company norms.

Different communication channles have different uses.
 : Rather than use every technology as an always-on channel, use the best tool for the job.

Get in and get out.
 : Group chat is great for replacing in-person meetings but terrible if it becomes an all-day affair.

Schedule time for group chat on your calendar.
 : Let colleagues know when you'll be in group chat and use the 'Do Not Disturb' function to let people know when you're out.

Be selective.
 : Group chat is good for some topics, people and conversations and bad for  others.

Slow down conversations.
 : Ask participants who like to 'think out loud' in group chat to write down their ideas to share later.

#### Hack Back Meetings

Make it harder to call a meeting.
 : To call a meeting, the organiser must circulate an agenda and briefing document.

Meeting are for consensus-building.
 : With few exceptions, creative problem-solving should occur before the meeting, individually or in very small groups.

Be fully present.
 : People use devices during meetings to escape monotony and boredom, which subsequently makes meetings even worse.

Have one laptop per meeting.
 : Devices in everyone's hands makes it more difficult to achieve the purpose of the meeting.
   With the exception of one laptop in the room for presenting information and taking notes, leave devices outside.

#### Hack Back Your Smartphone

You can hack back the external triggers on your phone in four steps in less than one hour.
 : 1. Remove - Uninstall the apps you no longer need.
   2. Replace - Shift where and when you use potentially distracting apps, like social media and YouTube, to your desk instead of on your phone. Get a wristwatch so you don't have to look at your phone for the time.
   3. Rearrange - Move any apps that may trigger mindless checking from your phone's home screen.
   4. Reclaim - Change the notification settings for each app. Be very selective regarding which apps can send you sound and sight cues. Learn to use your phone's 'Do Not Disturb' settings.

#### Hack Back Your Desktop

Desktop clutter takes a heavy psychological toll on your attention.
 : Clearing away external triggers in your digital workspace can help you stay focussed.

Turn off desktop notifications.
 : Disabling notifications on your computer ensures you won't get distracted by external triggers while doing focused work.

#### Hack Back Online Articles

Online articles are full of potentially distracting external triggers.
 : Open tabs can pull us off course and tend to suck us down a time-wasting content vortex.

Make a rule
 : Promise yourself you'll save interesting content for later by using an app like Pocket.

Surprise! You can multitask.
 : Use multichannel multitasking like listening to articles while working out or taking walking meeting.

#### Hack Back Feeds

Feeds like the ones we scroll through on social media are designed to keep you engaged.
 : Feeds are full of external triggers that can drive us to distraction.

Take control of feeds by hacking back.
 : Use free browser extensions like News Feed Eradicator for Facebook, Newsfeed Burner, Open Multiple Websites, and DF Tube to remove distracting external triggers.

#### The Power of Precommitments

Being indistractable not only requires keeping distraction out.
 : It also necessitates reining ourselves in.

Precommitments can reduce the likelihood of distraction.
 : They help us stick to decisions we've made in advance.

Precommitments should only be used after the other three indistractable strategies have already been applied.
 : Don't skip the first three steps.

#### Prevent Distraction with Effort Pacts

An effort pact prevents distraction by making unwanted behaviours more difficult to be.
 : -

In the age of the personal computer, social pressure to stay on task has largely disappeared.
 : No one can see what you're working on, so it's easier to slack off.
   Working next to a colleague of friend for a set period of time can be a highly effective effort pact.

You can use tech to stay off tech.
 : Apps like SelfControl and Forest can help you make effort pacts with yourself.

#### Prevent Distraction with Price Pacts

A price pact adds a cost to getting distracted.
 : It has been shown to be a highly effective motivator.

Price pacts are most effective when you can remove the external triggers that lead to distraction.
 : -

Price pacts work best when the distraction is temporary.
 : -

Price pacts can be difficult to start.
 : We fear making a price pact because we know we'll actually have to do the thing we're scared to do.

Learn self-compassion before making a price pact.
 : -

#### Prevent Distraction with Identity Pacts

Identity greatly influences our behaviour.
 : People tend to align their actions with how they see themselves.

An Identity pact is a precommitment to a self-image.
 : You can prevent distraction by acting in line with your identity.

Become a noun.
 : By assigning yourself a moniker, you increase the likelihood of following through with behaviours consistent with what you call yourself.
   Call your self 'indistractable'.

Share with others
 : Teaching others solidifies your commitment, even if you're still struggling.
   A great way to be indistractable is to tell friends about what you learned in this book and the changes you're making in your life.

Adopt rituals
 : Repeating mantras, keeping a timeboxed schedule, or performing other routines, reinforces your identity and influences your future actions.

#### Distraction is a Sign of Dysfunction

Jobs where employees encounter high expectations and low control have been shown to lead to symptoms of depression.
 : -

Depression-like symptoms are painful.
 : When people feel bad, they use distractions to avoid their pain and regain a sense of control.

Tech overuse at work is a symptom of a dysfunctional company culture.
 : -

More tech use makes the underlying problems worse, perpetuating a ‘cycle of responsiveness’.
 : -

#### Fixing Distraction is a Test of Company Culture

Don’t suffer in silence.
 : A workplace where people can’t talk about technology overuse is also one where people keep other important issues (and insights) to themselves.

Knowing that your voice matters is essential.
 : Teams that foster psychological safety and facilitate regular open discussions about concerns not only have fewer problems with distraction, but also have happier employees and customers.

#### The Indistractable Workplace

Indistractable organisations, like Slack and BCG, foster psychological safety, provide a place for open discussions about concerns, and, most importantly, have leaders who exemplify the importance of doing focused work.
 : -

#### Avoid Convenient Excuses

Stop deflecting blame.
 : When kids don’t act the way parents want them to, it’s natural to look for answers that help parents divert responsibility.

Techno-panics are nothing new.
 : From the book, to the radio, to video games, the history of parenting is strewn with examples of moral panic over things that supposedly make kids act in strange ways.

Tech isn’t evil.
 : Used in the right way and in the right amounts, kids’ tech use can be beneficial, while too much (or too little) can have slightly harmful effects.

Teach kids to be indistractable.
 : Teaching children how to manage distraction will benefit them throughout their lives.

#### Understand Their Internal Triggers

Internal triggers drive behaviour.
 : To understand how to help kids manage distraction, we need to start by understanding the source of the problem.

Our kids need psychological nutrients.
 : According to a widely accepted theory of human motivation, all people need three things to thrive: a sense of autonomy, competence and relatedness.

Distractions satisfy deficiencies.
 : When our kids’ psychological needs are not met in the real world, they go looking for satisfaction – often in virtual environments.

Kids need alternatives.
 : Parents and guardians can take steps to help kids find a balance between their online and offline worlds by providing more offline opportunities to find autonomy, competence and relatedness.

The four-part Indistractable Model is valuable for kids as well.
 : Teach them methods for handling distraction and, most importantly, model being indistractable yourself.

#### Make Time for Traction Together

Teach traction.
 : With so many potential distractions in kids’ lives, teaching them how to make time for traction is critical.

Just as with our own timeboxed schedules, kids can learn how to make time for what’s important to them.
 : In the absence of making their own plans in advance, kids will turn to distractions.

It’s okay to let your kids fail.  
 : Failure is how we learn.
   Show kids how to adjust their schedules to make time to live up to their values.

#### Help Them with External Triggers

Teach them to swim before they dive in.
 : Like swimming in a pool, children should not be allowed to partake in certain risky behaviours before they are ready.

Test for tech readiness.
 : A good measure of a child’s readiness is their ability to manage distraction by using the settings on the device to turn off external triggers.

Kids need sleep.
 : There is little justification for having a television or other potential distractions in a kid’s room overnight.
   Make sure nothing gets in the way of getting good rest.

Don’t be the unwanted external trigger.
 : Respect their time and don’t interrupt them when they have scheduled time to focus on something, be that work or play.

#### Teach Them to Make Their Own Pacts

Don’t underestimate your child’s ability to precommit and follow through.
 : Even young children can learn to use precommitments as long as they set the rules and know how to use a timer or some other binding system.

Consumer scepticism is healthy.
 : Understanding that companies are motivated to keep kids spending time watching or playing is an important part of teaching media literacy.

Put the kids in charge.
 : It’s only when kids practise monitoring their own behaviour that they learn how to manage their own time and attention.

#### Spread Social Antibodies Among Friends

Distraction in social situations can keep us from being fully present with important people in our lives.
 : Interruptions degrade our ability to form close social bonds.

Block the spread of unhealthy behaviours.
 : ‘Social antibodies’ are ways groups protect themselves from harmful behaviours by making them taboo.

Develop new social norms.
 : We can tackle distraction among friends the same way we beat social smoking, by making it unacceptable to use devices in social situations.
   Prepare a few tactful phrases, such as asking ‘Is everything OK?’ to discourage phone usage among friends.

#### Be an Indistractable Lover

Distraction can be an impediment in our most intimate relationships.
 : Instant digital connectivity can come at the expense of being fully present with those beside us.

Indistractable partners reclaim time for togetherness.
 : Following the four steps to becoming indistractable can ensure you make time for your partner.

Now it’s your turn to become indistractable.
