### OFF

off the record
 : 비공식적으로

#### Case 1. 물리적 떨어짐의 off

The painting fell off the wall.

I'm getting off at the next step.

Get your hands off me.

#### Case 2. 장소, 위치에서의 이탈 off

I'm off! See you later!

I'm off to Europe tomorrow. See you when I'm back!

Where is he off to?

#### Case 3. 추상적인 분리의 off

What time do you get off work?

Should I take a day off today?

Stay off the grass.

Back off, let me handle this on my own.

If the snake is hissing, back off.

#### Case 4. 기존 상태에서 이탈하는 off

I think this milk has gone sour. It tastes off.

You seem a bit off. Are you okay?
