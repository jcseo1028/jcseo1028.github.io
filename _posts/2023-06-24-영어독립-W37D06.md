### MAKE

Make your bed every morning.

#### Case 1. 만들다

I made two cups of coffee.

The bag is made in Italy.

#### Case 2. (추상적인) 만들다

We all make mistakes. So, cheer up.

Thank you for the present. You made my day.

make one's day
 : 기분 좋은 일을 주다

#### Case 3. 행동을 하게 만들다

The boss made me go on a business trip.

Don't worry. I will make it happen.

#### Case 4. 해내다, 이르다, 가다

You made it! I heard you are very busy today.

Congratulations! I heard you made it to the finals.
