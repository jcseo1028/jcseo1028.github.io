We consider it normal

to let our sedentary lifestyles creep in as we age,

but this is far from the truth.

let(allow) A creep in
 : A가 은밀히 들어오도록 허락하다.

If you let bad habits creep into your daily routine, they will become harder and harder to break.

creep in
 : 소리없이 들어오다, 영향을 끼치다.

far from the truth
 : 진실과 거리가 먼

sedentary
 : 주로 앉아서 생활하는
