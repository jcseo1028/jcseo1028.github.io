### Remember this expression

```text
The more / -er ~, the more / -er ~
(~ 할수록 더 ~ 하다)
```

The more I decorate the cake, the uglier it gets.

The more I tried persuade her, the more she kept her distance from me.

The more you work out, the more fit you get.

The more, the merrier.

The sooner, the better.

work out
 : 운동하다

persuade
 : 설득시키다, 납득시키다.
