#### Extreme Risks Not Reauired!

Oftentimes, people who succeed as entrepreneurs are considered to be quite brave and courageous because usually we expert someone who has achieved success has done so by taking some very big risks.

entrepreneur
 : 사업가

We are familiar with statements such as "If you're not all in, you're out." or "Go big, or go home!"

In this book, Grant explains that extreme risks aren't always required in order to achieve significant success.

extreme
 : 극도의, 극심한
   극도, 극단

Yes, there are inherent risks to being an entrepreneur, but those risks can be balanced by being conservative and careful in different areas.

inherent
 : 내재하는

conservative
 : 보수적인

Entrepreneurs also struggle with ambivalence, fear, and a lack of self-confidence.

struggle
 : 투쟁하다, 몸부림 치다.

ambivalence
 : 양면성

While it may look like entrepreneurs look for risks and enjoy taking them, most entrepreneurs actually work to avoid risks.

The common misperception is that most entrepreneurs have up and resigned from their regular careers and risked their health and home in order to commit fully to their business ideas before they actually succeed.

misperception
 : 오인, 오해

resign
 : 사임하다, 물러나다.

Actually, many entrepreneurs keep their regular day jobs for a very long time even after they have achieved a level of success for the entrepreneurial endeavor.

entrepreneurial
 : 기업가의

endeavor
 : 노력, 시도

In fact, those are the entrepreneurs who actually achieve long-term success more often than the ones who desert their day jobs in the very beginning of a business start-up.

desert
 : 사막
   버리다, 저버리다(=abandon)

The creative people who dreamed up and started eBay, Apple, Warby Parker, and Google kept working their day jobs for a significant amount of time after their companies reached a level of success.

dream up
 : 생각해 내다, 발명해 내다.

Even the best-selling author Stephen King and the famous Queen guitarist John Legend kept working their regular jobs once their creative ideas became reality.

Keeping a day job provides much stability for the entrepreneur when taking considerable risks for a new venture.

It will also help ensure there has been enough time to test and perfect a product before it hits the market. 

Not only that, but keeping that secure day job provides opportunities to take bigger risks during the start-up phase of a creative idea. 

Those starting Warby Parker, an eyeglass company built online, is a great example of this. 

The four individuals who created Warby Parker all stayed on their regular internships and day jobs while launching the company. 

They used the extra time to careful analyze their start-up business plan and prepare for serious risks and challenges they might encounter once it started. 

Because of this, they were able to build an amazing success in the business online that many believed would fail.

People who have succeeded in becoming entrepreneurs share another common trait that was discovered over the course of several research studies – most of them tended to take limited risks during their teenage years. 

trait
 : (성격상의) 특성

As teenagers, quite a few of them tried risky things like smoking marijuana, drinking alcohol, and minor shoplifting, but they did not allow those risky behaviors to go to the extreme and turn into drunk driving or felony theft.

felony
 : 흉악 범죄

The point is they gave themselves permission to take risks without going beyond a certain point of safety. 

permission
 : 허락, 승인

In his book, Grant explains that being a unique and individual person means you must be open to new things and new ideas. 

However, being open to new things also comes with a cautious attitude just like someone who walks a tightrope between two skyscrapers is cautious enough to have a safety harness just in case.

cautious
 : 조심스러운, 신중한

skyscraper
 : 고층 건물

harness
 : 마구(馬具, 벨트 같은...)
   마구를 채우다.

Unique people are determined to do things better if possible – whether or not it takes more work to do so. 

For example, people with this type of attitude aren’t satisfied with using whatever browser their computer is set to default to such as Safari or Internet Explorer. 

They look to Chrome or Firefox to see if they work better than the default. 

In similar fashion, people who have fewer advantages in life often take things as they are and will often give up their rights without a fight while those who happen to have had more advantages from growing up with higher income levels tend to fight for the rights they believe they deserve. 

in (a)... fashion
 : ... 방식으로

deserve
 : ~ 을 받을만하다. ~ 을 해야 마땅하다.

Those without certain advantages might live believing they are merely victims to an unfair system and find it safer to do so than trying to draw attention to it in order to effect change: 

merely
 : 한낱, 그저, 단지

victim
 : 피해자, 재물

unfair
 : 부당한, 불공평한

“If the world is supposed to be this way, we don't need to be dissatisfied with it.” 

People who aspire to hold on to their originality must be willing to stand against common standards and fight for something better.

originality
 : 독창성

stand against
 : ~ 에 저항하다. ~에 기대다

The online eyeglass company Warby Parker was the creative solution four college students came up with when they began to challenge the ridiculously high cost of obtaining prescription eyewear. 

ridiculously
 : 터무니없이

prescription
 : 처방전

When they began to look into the matter, they discovered that one big company dominated the industry and thus was able to sell eyeglasses marked up more than a hundred times what they actually cost to produce. 

dominate
 : 지배하다, 군림하다.

These four guys chose to fight that common standard, or status quo as it was, and in doing so, they created a hugely successful business of selling eyeglasses online for a simple $95 after customers had a chance to try them at home for free.

status quo
 : 현재의 상황

Women’s suffrage is another great example of the same issue. 

suffrage
 : 투표권, 참정권

They decided to challenge the status quo – the common standard of the time – that only men were allowed to vote. 

Their decision not to accept that any more led to a movement that changed the world when women gained the right to vote as well.

In the business world, empowering employees with the knowledge that jobs are not rigid is good for the overall health of the company. 

empower
 : 권한을 주다, 자율권을 주다.

rigid
 : 엄격한, 융통성 없는, 뻣뻣한

Allowing employees to mold their positions to best fit their own passions and skills while serving the company as needed at the same time provides more room for promotion, satisfaction with their job, and a lessening of self-imposed limitations. 
 
For the most part, unique individuals don’t usually seek or readily embrace public placements where they are highly visible. 

embrace
 : 안다. 포옹하다.

For example, prior to being chosen to give a speech at the March on Washington, Martin Luther King, Jr. was actually afraid of speaking in a public setting. 

Copernicus, the man who discovered the sun did not revolve around the earth and that the opposite was actually true, was too reticent to publish his amazing discovery himself. 

opposite
 : 다른 편의, 반대의

reticent
 : 말을 잘 안하는

In fact, his findings were not published until 26 years later when another professor decided to publicize Copernicus’ discovery for him. 

It can often be quite challenging to get past a natural fear and resistance for offering new ideas: 

“Advocating for new systems often requires demolishing the old way of doing things, and we hold back for fear of rocking the boat.”

advocate
 : 옹호하다, 지지하다.

#### How to Know which Great Idea is the Best (or Right) One

Every idea is not necessarily a good one, nor will a new business idea or start-up always be successful. 

When you are personally close to anything, it can actually hinder your ability to analyze it accurately.

hinder
 : 저해하다. ~을 못하게하다.

It can be challenging to get someone to give you an unbiased perspective on your seemingly great idea.

unbiased
 : 편견 없는, 편파적이지 않은

perspective
 : 관점, 시각, 원근감

seemingly
 : 겉보기에는, 보아하니(=apparently)


If you want a sure-fire way to succeed in finding the best idea that will be right for what you want, create a plethora of ideas! 

sure-fire
 : 확실한, 틀림없는

plethora
 : 과다, 과잉(=excess)

A plethora or mega-volume of whatever you are trying to do will serve to increase the odds that you will hit on the right one. 

mega-volume
 : 방대한 양(의)

odds
 : 역경, 곤란

For example, Picasso drew around 12,000 pictures and put together more than 5,800 actual works – he was definitely going to make at least one or two masterpieces out of that many works of art completed. 

Maya Angelou didn’t just write a poem or two and expect them to be masterpieces of poetry. 

She wrote 165 poems in all. 

Einstein put out a great amount of writings, 248 or so. 

People who are extremely creative will produce an extreme volume of whatever they are creating. 

extemely
 : 극도로, 극히

Oftentimes historical treasures created by famous artists were actually produced during a time period when they were especially hard at work producing their art in multiples.

If you want to produce your own original work successfully, another key characteristic you need is the ability to not become obsessed with perfection. 

obsess
 : 사로잡다, 강박감을 갖다.

Perfectionism can kill or significantly hamper creativity when you narrow down your thought process and focus on just one idea or one way of doing things. 

Perfectionism
 : 완벽주의

hamper
 : 방해하다.

The goal is to create multiples of proto-types or ideas because the best ones will most likely be found in the midst of the multiples. 

As with anything else, occasionally there will be exceptions to this concept. 

occasionally
 : 가끔

Every now and then, someone will reach that successful product or idea very early on in the process – sometimes even the very first time. 

However, that is the exception rather than the norm. 

norm
 : 표준, 기준

Usually creative people find success through the process of generating a lot of ideas and/or products.

Once you think you discovered the brilliant idea you’re looking for, you need something very important in able to be sure that you have. 

Grant explains how feedback can provide the assurance that you have indeed hit on a great idea. 

Each of us may be completely adamant that we truly have hit on that wonderful idea, but that very confidence can be taken too far to the detriment of success because it leaves us unwilling or unable to see it realistically. 

adamant
 : 요지부동의, 단호한

confidence
 : 신뢰

detriment
 : 손상

That is why it is important to share the discovery with trusted individuals and openly analyze what they have to say about it in return. 

Being willing to listen to constructive criticism and valid feedback will actually provide a clearer path for you to follow to success.

Quite often, the best people to provide this type of feedback are those who are also creative thinkers and fellow entrepreneurs. 

fellow
 : 동료

These individuals are better equipped to recognize creativity and originality in others and offer sincere and honest feedback in return. 

sincere
 : 진실된

originality
 : 독창성

When you are looking for such help in the business world or your career, it is best to look to colleagues and peers instead of employers, supervisors, and managers. 

Those in leadership are generally trained to avoid risks and maintain the standards set by the owners of the business – regardless of the facts of the situation. 

Remember that new ideas differing from the status quo are much harder to gain consideration or acceptance.

When you are seeking unbiased analysis of your unique idea or project, it can help to have those evaluating your proposal do some creative but unrelated exercises first. 

This enables them to broaden their thinking in the moment and look at your idea with an open mind in order to evaluate potential properly. 
 
Creativity also has a lot to do with one of the highest honors of original thinking – the Nobel Prize. 

Studies focused on scientists who have won the honor found that winners were connected to the arts more often than not when compared to their industry peers. 

Dance, music, and acting were common activities for a majority of the winners. 

When it comes to the same topic focused on successful entrepreneurs, creativity is commonly exhibited by their participation in hobbies involving the performing arts regardless of the type of business where they achieved their success. 

In general, the findings of the studies show how very important it is to have an open mind willing to consider novel solutions and think outside of the box in order to be successful.

However, creativity doesn’t necessarily have to involve the typical categories of performing arts. 

Exploring other countries and their inherent cultures can also boost creativity significantly. 

The more a culture and country differ from your home country, the more inspiration for creativity can be found. 

inspiration
 : 영감

It also helps to spend a significant amount of time immersed in that different culture in order to get a better understanding of the differences. 

immerse
 : 담그다, 몰두하다

The author of this book recommends we avoid relying primarily on our intuition or “gut feelings” when analyzing other people. 

intuition
 : 직관력

Grant suggests we look beyond exciting presentations designed to impress and analyze the facts along with the action plan for success in order to evaluate whether or not an idea or product might be ready to succeed. 

The primary consideration isn’t necessarily the success itself, but rather it’s how that success has been achieved. 
 
Honest and open evaluation of your own idea is extremely helpful. 

Think about all the ways your idea might fail and create solutions to meet that possible failure. 

Focus on the feedback from others analyzing your ideas in the same manner. 

Encourage them to look for and share negative perspectives, and use that information to better develop your idea. 

Everyone involved with the idea, project, or product should also have access to the detailed feedback in order to fix problem areas that have been pointed out.
