The Oak and the Reeds

There was a giant oak tree near a river where reeds grew.
Whenever the wind blew, the great oak tree stood proudly upright with its arms lifted to the sky.
But the reeds bowed low in the wind.
"Even the slightest breeze makes you bow your head, while I, the mighty oak, can stand upright and strong," said the oak tree arrogantly.
"Don't worry about us," replied the reeds.
"The wind doesn't hurt us."
A few days later, there was a big storm.
The oak tree stood proudly and fought against the storm.
But the reeds bowed lower as the wind got even stronger.
All at once, the oak tree fell.
Better to yield than to resist stubbornly and destroyed.
