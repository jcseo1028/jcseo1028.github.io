#### Extreme Risks Not Reauired!

Oftentimes, people who succeed as entrepreneurs are considered to be quite brave and courageous because usually we expert someone who has achieved success has done so by taking some very big risks.

entrepreneur
 : 사업가

We are familiar with statements such as "If you're not all in, you're out." or "Go big, or go home!"

In this book, Grant explains that extreme risks aren't always required in order to achieve significant success.

extreme
 : 극도의, 극심한
   극도, 극단

Yes, there are inherent risks to being an entrepreneur, but those risks can be balanced by being conservative and careful in different areas.

inherent
 : 내재하는

conservative
 : 보수적인

Entrepreneurs also struggle with ambivalence, fear, and a lack of self-confidence.

struggle
 : 투쟁하다, 몸부림 치다.

ambivalence
 : 양면성

While it may look like entrepreneurs look for risks and enjoy taking them, most entrepreneurs actually work to avoid risks.

The common misperception is that most entrepreneurs have up and resigned from their regular careers and risked their health and home in order to commit fully to their business ideas before they actually succeed.

misperception
 : 오인, 오해

resign
 : 사임하다, 물러나다.

Actually, many entrepreneurs keep their regular day jobs for a very long time even after they have achieved a level of success for the entrepreneurial endeavor.

entrepreneurial
 : 기업가의

endeavor
 : 노력, 시도

In fact, those are the entrepreneurs who actually achieve long-term success more often than the ones who desert their day jobs in the very beginning of a business start-up.

desert
 : 사막
   버리다, 저버리다(=abandon)
