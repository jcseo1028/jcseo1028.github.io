#### Extreme Risks Not Reauired!

Oftentimes, people who succeed as entrepreneurs are considered to be quite brave and courageous because usually we expert someone who has achieved success has done so by taking some very big risks.

We are familiar with statements such as "If you're not all in, you're out." or "Go big, or go home!"

In this book, Grant explains that extreme risks aren't always required in order to achieve significant success.

extreme
 : 극도의, 극심한
   극도, 극단

Yes, there are inherent risks to being an entrepreneur, but those risks can be balanced by being conservative and careful in different areas.

 : 내재하는

conservative
 : 보수적인

Entrepreneurs also struggle with ambivalence, fear, and a lack of self-confidence.

struggle
 : 투쟁하다, 몸부림 치다.

ambivalence
 : 양면성

While it may look like entrepreneurs look for risks and enjoy taking them, most entrepreneurs actually work to avoid risks.
