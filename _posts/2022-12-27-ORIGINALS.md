#### Extreme Risks Not Reauired!

Oftentimes, people who succeed as entrepreneurs are considered to be quite brave and courageous because usually we expert someone who has achieved success has done so by taking some very big risks.

 : 사업가

We are familiar with statements such as "If you're not all in, you're out." or "Go big, or go home!"

In this book, Grant explains that extreme risks aren't always required in order to achieve significant success.

extreme
 : 극도의, 극심한
   극도, 극단

Yes, there are inherent risks to being an entrepreneur, but those risks can be balanced by being conservative and careful in different areas.

inherent
 : 내재하는

conservative
 : 보수적인

Entrepreneurs also struggle with ambivalence, fear, and a lack of self-confidence.

struggle
 : 투쟁하다, 몸부림 치다.

ambivalence
 : 양면성

While it may look like entrepreneurs look for risks and enjoy taking them, most entrepreneurs actually work to avoid risks.

The common misperception is that most entrepreneurs have up and resigned from their regular careers and risked their health and home in order to commit fully to their business ideas before they actually succeed.

misperception
 : 오인, 오해

resign
 : 사임하다, 물러나다.

Actually, many entrepreneurs keep their regular day jobs for a very long time even after they have achieved a level of success for the entrepreneurial endeavor.

 : 기업가의

endeavor
 : 노력, 시도

In fact, those are the entrepreneurs who actually achieve long-term success more often than the ones who desert their day jobs in the very beginning of a business start-up.

desert
 : 사막
   버리다, 저버리다(=abandon)

The creative people who dreamed up and started eBay, Apple, Warby Parker, and Google kept working their day jobs for a significant amount of time after their companies reached a level of success.

dream up
 : 생각해 내다, 발명해 내다.

Even the best-selling author Stephen King and the famous Queen guitarist John Legend kept working their regular jobs once their creative ideas became reality.

Keeping a day job provides much stability for the entrepreneur when taking considerable risks for a new venture.

It will also help ensure there has been enough time to test and perfect a product before it hits the market. 

Not only that, but keeping that secure day job provides opportunities to take bigger risks during the start-up phase of a creative idea. 

Those starting Warby Parker, an eyeglass company built online, is a great example of this. 

The four individuals who created Warby Parker all stayed on their regular internships and day jobs while launching the company. 

They used the extra time to careful analyze their start-up business plan and prepare for serious risks and challenges they might encounter once it started. 

Because of this, they were able to build an amazing success in the business online that many believed would fail.
