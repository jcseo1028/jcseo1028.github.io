The Goose with the Golden Eggs

A man and his wife were lucky enough to own a goose that laid a golden egg every day.
However, imagining that the bird must be full of gold inside, they decided to kill it to get all the golden eggs at once.
But when they cut it open, they found that it was just like any other goose.
So, they didn't get rich all at once as they hoped, and they could no longer enjoy the daily addition to their wealth.
Much wants more and loses all.

at once
 : 한번에, 동시에


When they cut it open, they found that it was just like any other goose.

I found my mother's words to be true.

Much wants more and loses all.
 : (속담) 이미 많을 것을 가진 자가 더 많을 것을 바라다가 모든 것을 잃는다.


I didn't do much of the homework.

I finished more of the homework than him.

I finished all of the homework.
