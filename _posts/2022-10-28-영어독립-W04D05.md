The Lion and The Mouse

One day when a lion was sleeping, a little mouse began running up and down on him.
Annoyed, the lion woke up and opened his big jaws to swallow the little creature.
"Excuse me, King" cried the little mouse.
"If you forgive me this time. I will never forget it. I might be able to help you some day, who knows?"
The lion was eventually convinced by the mouse and let him go.
A few days later, the lion got caught in a trap.
The whole animal kingdom heard him roar, but only the little mouse went to check it out.
Seeing the lion in danger, he chewed away the ropes and freed the lion.
Little friends may prove great friends.
