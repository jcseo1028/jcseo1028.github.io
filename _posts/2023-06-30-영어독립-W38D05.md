Two travelers and the Purse

Two men were walking down a road together when one of the them picked up a purse.
"I'm so lucky!" he said. "I found a purse. Judging by its weight, it must be full of gold."
The other man raised an eyebrow, thinking that traverlers should share their good luck and bad luck throughout their journey.
"You should say 'we have found a purse' and 'how lucky are we,'" said his companion.
"No, no," replied the other angrily. "I found it, so I am going to take it."
Just then, they heard someone shout "Stop, thief!" and saw a mob of people armed with clubs coming down the road.
The man who found the purse began to panic.
"We are doomed if they find us with the purse," he cried.
"No, no," replied the other, "You would not say 'we' before, so now stick to your 'I'. Say 'I am doomed.'"
We cannot expect anyone to share our misfortunes unless we are willing to share our good fortune also.

My palms began to sweat when I walked out on stage.

We cannot expect anyone to share our misfortunes unless we are willing to share our good fortune also.

Don't expect people to be nice to you.
