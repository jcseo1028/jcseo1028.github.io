The Fox and the Goat

One day, a fox fell down a well and couldn't get out.
After being stuck for a long time, a thirsty goat came by.
The goat thought the fox had gone down to drink, so he asked if the water was good.
"It's the best water ever," said the sly fox, "jump in and try it. There is more than enough for the both of us."
The thirsty goat immediately jumped in and began to drink.
The fox quickly jumped on the goat's back and leaped out of the well.
The foolish goat, realizing his mistake, begged the fox to help him out.
But the fox was already on his way.
"If your judgement was as good as your beard," he said as he ran.
"You would have been more catious about finding a way to get out of the well before you jumped in."
Look before you leap.
