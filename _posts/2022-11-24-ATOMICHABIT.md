   4. Make it satisfying(or unsatisfying)

#### The Building Blocks of Habit

```
The purpose of setting goals is to win the game.
The purpose of building systems is to continue playing game.
```

- Improving by one percent every day really adds up ( 하루 1% 씩 성장?)
- Small changes may not appear to be working until you reach a certain tipping point.
- Atoms from morecules, and habits form system.
- Systems are more productive than habits.

#### Your Habits Determine Who You Are

Three layer of behaviou change
 : Outcomes (these are goal oriented, like losing weight)
   Processes (these are habits, like exercising)
   Identity (These are your beliefs, primarily about yourself, like "I am a healthy, fit person")

#### Four Steps to Better Habits

Habits work in a four step cycle.
 : 1. Cue : noticing the reward
   2. Craving : wanting the reward.
   3. Response : getting the reward.
   4. Reward

#### Recognizing the Power of Habits

```
By adding a "point and call" practice to daily behaviour, and creating a scorecard of positive, negative, and neutral habits,
you can increase your awareness of those habits, which is the first step in effecting change. 
```
결국엔 Daily Report(score card) + 자기암시 인듯.
