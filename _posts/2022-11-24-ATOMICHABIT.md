#### Super Summary

The four steps of habit become the four laws of behavior.
 : Cue
   Craving
   Response
   Reward

The corresponding laws to encourage or discourage behaviour are
 : 1. Make it obvious(or invisible)
   2. Make it attractive (or unattractive)
   3. Make it easy(or difficult)
   4. Make it satisfying(or unsatisfying)

#### The Building Blocks of Habit

```
The purpose of setting goals is to win the game.
The purpose of building systems is to continue playing game.
```

- Improving by one percent every day really adds up ( 하루 1% 씩 성장?)
- Small changes may not appear to be working until you reach a certain tipping point.
- Atoms from morecules, and habits form system.
- Systems are more productive than habits.

#### Your Habits Determine Who You Are

Three layer of behaviou change
 : Outcomes (these are goal oriented, like losing weight)
   Processes (these are habits, like exercising)
   Identity (These are your beliefs, primarily about yourself, like "I am a healthy, fit person")

#### Four Steps to Better Habits

Habits work in a four step cycle.
 : 1. Cue : noticing the reward
   2. Craving : wanting the reward.
   3. Response : getting the reward.
   4. Reward

#### Recognizing the Power of Habits

```
By adding a "point and call" practice to daily behaviour, and creating a scorecard of positive, negative, and neutral habits,
you can increase your awareness of those habits, which is the first step in effecting change. 
```
결국엔 Daily Report(score card) + 자기암시 인듯.

#### Getting Started

- The First Law of Behavior is to Make it Obvious.
- Implementation intentions and habit stacking are simple strategies for creating obvious cues for your new behavior.
- Implementation intention : "I will (action) at (time) in (place)."
- Habit stacking : "After I (action done daily) I will (new desired action)."

#### Motivation Versus Environment

- Small changes in environment can trigger big changes in behavior.
- Habits are triggered by cues; we can change the cues, or make them more less obvious.
- It is easier to build new habits in a new environment.

#### Self Control is Overrated

- You can break a bad habit, but you are unlikely to forget it.
- People who appear to have great self-control probably spend less time in tempting environment.
- Self-control is a more effective short-term solution than a long term strategy.

#### Make a Habit Attractive

- The Second Law of Behavior Change is "Make it Attractive".
- Habits are dopamine dependent.
- The anticipation of the reward is greater than the reward itself.
- Temptation building can be combined with habit stacking.

#### Cultural Influences

- The culture we live in determines what habits we find attractive.
- We adopt these group preferences because we want to fit in.
- In order to build better habits, it is helpful to join a group where you already have commonalities and your desired behavior is already part of the group behavior.

#### Making a Bad Habit Undesirable

- All behavior has a conscious level of craving and a subconscious level of motive.
- Cues are predictions of the feeling that will result from the behavior or habit.
- Remind yourself of the negative aspects of a habit(make it attractive) to eliminate it.
- Create a shortcut for the feeling associated with a positive habit.

#### Forward Motion

- The third law of behavior change is "Make it Easy".
- Take action, don't just generate motion.
- The amount of time that passes is not as important to the formation of a habit as the number of repetitions of the action.

#### Take the Easy Way

- People naturally choose the option with the least effort involved, when there is a choice.
- Create an opportunity to choose positive habits, by making them easy.
- Discourage the opportunity for negative habits by making them harder or less convenient.

#### Use the Two Minute Rule

- Small choices have big impacts.
- You can sharpen your focus with the two minute rule.
- Make incremental changes and proceed in the right direction.

#### Take Drastic Action

- Make bad habits difficult through advance commitment.
- Make good habits easier through advance planning.

#### I Want it Now

 - People prefer immediate rewards to delayed rewards.
 - Delayed punishment are difficult to weigh and evaluate.
 - Give yourself small but relevant treats.

Laws so far(지금까지의 법칙)
 : 1. Make it obvious
   2. Make it attractive
   3. Make it easy
   4. Make it satisfying

#### Keeping on Track

- Don't overlook the satisfaction of making progress.
- Tracking can be simple or automated like providing a visual illustration of progress.
- "Don't miss twice"
- Measure the right things.

#### Be Accountable

- Inversion of the Fourth Law : Make it Unsatisfying
- Make a habit contract.
- Find an accountability partner.

#### Genetics Versus Hard Work
