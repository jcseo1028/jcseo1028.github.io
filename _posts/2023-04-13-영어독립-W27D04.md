For the moment, I hope to make a basic point:

there are different types of love.

They feel different,

and their underlying neurological basis is different.

She made a basic but very important point about today's agenda.

underlying
 : 기초를 이루는, 근본적인

basis
 : 근거, 이유, 기준

neurological
 : 신경의, 신경학의
