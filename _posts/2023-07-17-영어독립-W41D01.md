### Read it out loud

```text
I kept a straight face.
(난 태연한 표정을 유지했다.)
```

It was very funny, but I managed to keep a straight face.

Nancy kept a straight face, trying not to offend Jerry by laughing out loud.

I find it difficult to keep a straight face when I get angry.

offend
 : 기분을 상하게 하다, 불쾌하게 하다.

laugh out loud
 : 크게 웃다.
