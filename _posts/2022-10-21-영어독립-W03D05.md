The Man and the Snake

A farmer's son accidentally stepped on a snake's tail.
The snake turned around and bit him resulting in his death.
In a rage, the father cut off part of the snake's tail with an axe.
Eventually, the farmer thought he should make up with the snake, so he brought the snake some food and honey.
Then, he said, "Let's forgive and forgot; perhaps you were right to punish my son, but surely I was right to be friends again right?"
"No, no," said the snake;
"You can never forget the death of your son, and I can never forget the loss of my tail."
Injuries may be forgiven, but not forgotten.
