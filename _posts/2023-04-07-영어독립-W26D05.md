The Mother and the Wolf

Early one evening, a hungry wolf was prowling around a cottage at the edge of a village when he heard a child crying inside the house.
Then he heard the mother's voice say: "Be quiet, child! Stop your crying, or I will give you to the wolf!"
Surprised but delighted at the thought of such a delicious meal, the wolf settled down under an open window, waiting to have the child handed to him.
Although the child continued to cry, the wolf waited all day in vain.
Then, that evening, he heard the mother's voice again as she sat down near the window to sing and rock her baby to sleep.
"Don't worry, child! The wolf will not get you. No, no! Daddy is watching, and he will kill the wolf if he comes near!"
Just then, the father arrived home, and the wolf ran far away.
Do not believe everything you hear.
