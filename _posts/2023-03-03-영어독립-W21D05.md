The Stag and the Hunter

One day, a stag saw his reflection in the clear water while drinking from a spring.
He greatly admired the graceful arch of his antlers, but he was very ashamed of his skinny legs.
"How is it," he sighed, "that I am cursed with such skinny legs when I have such a magnificent crown."
Suddenly, he sensed a hunter nearby and immediately ran away through the forest.
He ran far away.
But after a while, his large antlers got caught in some tree branches.
The hunter caught up with him shortly after.
The deer realized that the legs he was so ashamed of would have saved him had it not been for the useless antlers.
We often make much of the ornamental and despise the useful.

I would have given up had it bot been for my mentor's patience.
