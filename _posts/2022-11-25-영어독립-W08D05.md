The Fox and the Mask

A fox sneaked into the storage of a theater.
Suddenly, he saw a face staring at him, and he was terrified; but after looking more closely, he realized it was only a mask that actor wear.
"Ah", said the fox, "you look perfect; it's so sad that you don't have a heart."
Outside show is a poor substitute for inner worth.
