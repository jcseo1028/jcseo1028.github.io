The Boy and the Nuts

A boy put his hand in a jar full of nuts.
He grabbed as many as he could, but when he tried to pull his hand out, he couldn't because of the neck of the jar.
He burst into tears because he wanted to keep the nuts.
A bystander said to him, "Be happy with half the quantity, and you will be able to pull your hand out."
Do not attempt too much at once.
