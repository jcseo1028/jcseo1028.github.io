### Remember this expression

```
As much as I'd love to
(진심으로 ~하고 싶지만)
```

As much as I'd love to help, your request is beyond my authority.

As much as I'd love to stay and chat with you, I have got to go now.

As much as I'd love to eat tacos, I won't be able to join this time.

beyond
 : 저편에, 건너편에, 그 너머에

authority
 : 권한, 권위

taco
 : 타코(멕시코 음식)
