#### DEFINING TAKERS

Taker 정의하기

We've all encountered that one person that has no problem doing all the taking. 

These are people who don't care about other people's needs but instead only focus on themselves. 

We call these people the takers. 

Regardless of what they do, their main motivation is simply to acquire attention, status or even rewards for themselves. 

regardless of
 : ~ 에 상관없이
 
People who are takers are expert at self-promoting. 

You'll notice them using the words "I" or "me" more, as opposed to "we." 

Majority of their language expresses domination and force and oftentimes, they are persuasive. 

dominate
 : 지배하다.

domination
 : 지배 

persuasive
 : 설득력 있는

They will not have qualms about flattering a person especially if they need something. 

qualm
 : 거리낌, 꺼림칙함

flatter
 : 아첨하다, 자기가 잘난 줄 착각하다.
 
Why do these individuals behave in such a selfish way?

selfish
 : 이기적인

Takers often express an aggressive and competitive viewpoint. 

aggressive
 : 공격적인

competitive
 : 경쟁을 하는, 경쟁심이 강한

To them, life is purely a brutal game that requires resourcefulness to take what you need and want in order to reward yourself. 

brutal
 : 잔혹한, 인정사정없는

resourcefulness
 : 자원이 많음.

It doesn't mean they won't help people. 

But takers will only help or work with other people as long as they see how it will benefit them first. 
 
One example of this is Ken Lay, a former CEO of the energy conglomerate, Enron. 

conglomerate
 : 복합기업, 집합체

He not only used company assets to give himself a loan but he also sold off $70 million worth of company stocks right before Enron fully collapsed. 

collapse
 : 붕괴되다.

As a result, he got off with a fortune while more than 20,000 other employees got nothing. 

fortune
 : 운, 재산
 
While this showcases takers in a bad light, by nature, taking isn't immoral. 

showcase
 : 공개행사, 진열장

immoral
 : 비도덕적인, 음란한

Worldfamous basketball player, Michael Jordan is also a taker. 

At the time of his basketball life, he was vocal about having majority of the revenue from the game be given to players. 

revenue
 : 수익, 수입

However, he changed his opinion later on the moment when he had his own team. 

And he has spoken repeatedly about his philosophy of "selfishness leading to success." 

philosophy
 : 철학

"selfishness leading to success." 
 : 성공을 이끄는 이기주의

Overall, each taker has a different viewpoint and motivation than the other. 

However, their main concept of the world is generally similar. 

Takers deem that the amount of pie is quite limited and it's their right to give themselves the largest slice possible.

deem
 : ~로 여기다, 생각하다

#### WHAT MAKES A GIVER?

무엇이 Giver를 만드는가?

You might have recalled at some instance how someone has given you a selfless favor. 

selfless
 : 사심 없는

favor
 : 호의

Whether it's help that came in the form of a helping hand in a project, a job or even advice, we've all met individuals who basically gave themselves without asking back. 

These people are called givers. 
 
These people happily share ideas, items or work with other people. 

In most of their dealings, they give more than what they can ever receive. 

They lend their experience, support and time without complaint. 

lend
 : 빌려주다.

They are not after recognition and prefer to focus on providing value to the individuals they come in contact with. 

For a giver, the capacity to help someone is worth it because it creates a positive vibe for all those that are involved. 

vibe
 : 분위기, 낌새, 느낌
 
A worthy example of a giver is George Meyer, Emmy award winning writer of The Simpsons. 

Over his entire career, he has contributed to over 300 episodes of the show. 

However, he is only listed in 12 episodes in the credits as the head writer. 

He basically wanted the show to succeed instead of focusing on taking the credit. 
 
After a little research, it was also discovered that he invented "meh." 

meh
 : 영 별로인

The word is used to signal apathy or boredom and was first used by Bart Simpson. 

apathy
 : 무관심

Today, you can find it in daily vocabulary and listed in dictionaries. 

Meyer didn't even take credit for it because he even forgot he created it. 

In fact, his associate writers needed to prompt him about it. 
 
For givers, they know that the main idea of collaboration is for the group to succeed. 

They mainly focus in creating an abundant environment for themselves as well as for the entire group around them.

abundant
 : 풍부한

#### MATCHERS AND FINDING A BALANCE

matcher
 : 잘 어울리는 사람. match 하는 사람.
