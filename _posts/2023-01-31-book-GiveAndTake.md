#### DEFINING TAKERS

We've all encountered that one person that has no problem doing all the taking. 

These are people who don't care about other people's needs but instead only focus on themselves. 

We call these people the takers. 

Regardless of what they do, their main motivation is simply to acquire attention, status or even rewards for themselves. 

regardless of
 : ~ 에 상관없이
 
People who are takers are expert at self-promoting. 

You'll notice them using the words "I" or "me" more, as opposed to "we." 

Majority of their language expresses domination and force and oftentimes, they are persuasive. 

dominate
 : 지배하다.

domination
 : 지배 

persuasive
 : 설득력 있는

They will not have qualms about flattering a person especially if they need something. 

qualm
 : 거리낌, 꺼림칙함

flatter
 : 아첨하다, 자기가 잘난 줄 착각하다.
 
Why do these individuals behave in such a selfish way?

selfish
 : 이기적인

Takers often express an aggressive and competitive viewpoint. 

aggressive
 : 공격적인

competitive
 : 경쟁을 하는, 경쟁심이 강한

To them, life is purely a brutal game that requires resourcefulness to take what you need and want in order to reward yourself. 

brutal
 : 잔혹한, 인정사정없는

resourcefulness
 : 자원이 많음.

It doesn't mean they won't help people. 

But takers will only help or work with other people as long as they see how it will benefit them first. 
 
One example of this is Ken Lay, a former CEO of the energy conglomerate, Enron. 

conglomerate
 : 복합기업, 집합체

He not only used company assets to give himself a loan but he also sold off $70 million worth of company stocks right before Enron fully collapsed. 

collapse
 : 붕괴되다.

As a result, he got off with a fortune while more than 20,000 other employees got nothing. 

fortune
 : 운, 재산
 
While this showcases takers in a bad light, by nature, taking isn't immoral. 

showcase
 : 공개행사, 진열장

immoral
 : 비도덕적인, 음란한

Worldfamous basketball player, Michael Jordan is also a taker. 

At the time of his basketball life, he was vocal about having majority of the revenue from the game be given to players. 

revenue
 : 수익, 수입

However, he changed his opinion later on the moment when he had his own team. 

And he has spoken repeatedly about his philosophy of "selfishness leading to success." 

philosophy
 : 철학

"selfishness leading to success." 
 : 성공을 이끄는 이기주의

Overall, each taker has a different viewpoint and motivation than the other. 

However, their main concept of the world is generally similar. 

Takers deem that the amount of pie is quite limited and it's their right to give themselves the largest slice possible.

deem
 : ~로 여기다, 생각하다
