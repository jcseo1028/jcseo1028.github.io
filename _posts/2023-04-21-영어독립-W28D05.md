The Dog and His Reflection

One day, a butcher threw a dog a bone, and the dog hurried home with his bone as fast as he could.
As he crossed a narrow footbridge, he looked down and saw his reflection in the water.
The greedy dog thought it was another dog carrying a bone much bigger than his own.
He dropped his bone and jumped at his reflection in the river only to find himself swimming for dear life.
Finally, he managed to scramble out and realized what a stupid dog he had been.
It is very foolish to be greedy.
