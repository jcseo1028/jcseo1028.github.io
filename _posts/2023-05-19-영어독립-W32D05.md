The Hare and His Ears

While having dinner, a lion was badly hurt by the horns of a goat.
The thought of any animal he chose for a meal being so bold as to wear such dangerours things enraged him greatly.
So, he commanded that all animals with horns should leave his domains.
All those who were so unfortunate to have horns began to pack up and move out.
Even the hare who, as you know, has no horns and ho had nothing to fear, had a very restless night, dreaming awful dreams about the fearful lion.
"Goodbye, neighbor cricket." he called the next day.
"I'm off. The lion will certainly make out that my ears are horns, no matter what I say."
Do not give your enemies the slightest reason to attack you.
They will seize any excuse.
