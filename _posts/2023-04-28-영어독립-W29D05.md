The Ant and the Dove

One day, a dove saw an ant fall into a brook.
The ant couldn't get out, so out of pity, the dove dropped a stick chose to it.
Clinging to the stick, the ant safely crawled out of the brook.
Shortly after, the ant saw a man getting ready to kill the dove with a stone.
Right as he threw the stone, the ant bit him on his heel.
The pain made him miss his target, and the startled dove flew to the woods.
Kindness is never wasted.
