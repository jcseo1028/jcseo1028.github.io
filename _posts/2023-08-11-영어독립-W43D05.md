The Ant and Grasshopper

One bright autumn day, an ant family was working in the warm sunshine.
They were drying out the grain they had stored up during the summer, when a starving grasshopper, his fiddle under his arm, came up humbly begged for a bite to eat.
"What!" cried the ants in surprise, "Haven't you stored anything away for the winter? What in the world were you doing all summer?"
"I didn't have time to store up any food," whined the grasshopper.
"I was so busy making music that before I knew it, summer was gone."
The ants strugged their shoulders in disgust.
"Making music? You could have done that all winter!"
There's a time for work and a time for play.

A starving grasshopper, his fiddle under his arm, came up and humbly begged for a bite to eat.

bite
 : 무는 행위, 음식을 물어뜯는 행위

bite-size
 : 한입 크기의

Let's grab a bite
 : 뭔가 간단히 먹으러 가자.

I won't bite
 : 안 잡아먹어 (무서워하지 마)

I was so busy making music that before I knew it, summer was gone.

before I knew it
 : 모르는 사이에

We'll be home befor we know it.

shrug one's shoulders
 : 어깨를 으쓱하다. 우쭐대다

disgust
 : 역겨움, 혐오감

humbly
 : 겸손하게, 겸손한

whine
 : 우는 소리를 내다, 투덜거리다
