The Crow and the Pitcher

One day during a dry spell, a thirsty crow found a pitcher with a little water in it.
But the pitcher was tall and had a narrow neck, so no matter how hard he tried, the crow could not reach the water.
The poor thing felt like he'd die of thirsty.
Then he had an idea.
Picking up some stones, he dropped them into the pitcher one by one.
With each stone, the water rose a little higher until at last, it was high enough for him to drink.
In a pinch, good use of our wits may help us out.

In a pinch, good use of our wits may help us out.
