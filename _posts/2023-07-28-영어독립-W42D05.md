The Boys and the Frogs

One day, some boys were playing at the edge of a pond.
The boys amused themselves by skipping stones across the water.
The stones were flying fast, and the boys were enjoying themselves very much, but the poor frogs in the pond were trembling with fear.
Finally, one of the frogs, the oldest and bravest, peeked his head out of the water and said,
"Oh, please, dear children, stop playing like that! It's cruel! It might be fun for you, but it's horrible for us!"
Always stop to think whether your fun may be the cause of another's unhappiness.
