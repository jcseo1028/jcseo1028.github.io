### Remember this expression

```text
Turn one's back on someone
(누군가를 배신하다)
```

I cannot turn my back on him. We have been business partners for more than a decade.

We can't just turn our backs on them when it is so difficult to find trustworthy people.

How can you turn your back on such a royal friend?

trustworthy
 : 신뢰할 수 있는

loyal
 : 충성스러운
