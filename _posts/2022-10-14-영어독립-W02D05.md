The Wolf and the Crane

A wolf was having dinner when suddenly a small bone got stuck in his throat.
He was in terrible pain and ran around begging everyone he met to remove the bone.
"I would give anything for you to take it out!"
Finally, a crane agreed to try.
The crane put its long neck down the wolf's throat and got the bone out.
"Will you please give me the reward you promissed?" ask the crane.
The wolf smiled and showed his teeth and said:
"You have put your head in and out of a wolf's mouth safely; that should be enough of a reward for you."
Gratitude and greed can never go together.
