The Bear and the Two Friend

Two friends came across a big bear when they were traveling.
One of the friends quickly climbed up a tree and hid among the branches.
The other fell flat on the ground and held his breath as the bear got close and smelled him all over.
Eventually, the bear left, so the other man came down from the tree and asked his friend what the bear said to him.
"He gave me this advice," his friend replied.
"Never travel with a friend who leaves you alone in danger."
Misfortune tests the sincerity of friend.
