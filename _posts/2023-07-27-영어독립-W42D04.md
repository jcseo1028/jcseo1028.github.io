Very often,

it's through a series of simple yet powerful questions

that people connect their own dots in their life

and experience breakthroughs.

connect the dots in life
 : 인생에서 점들을 연결하다.

I hope this new experience will help me connect the dots in my life.

breakthrough
 : 돌파구, 획기적인 발전

connect
 : 연결하다, 연관시키다.
