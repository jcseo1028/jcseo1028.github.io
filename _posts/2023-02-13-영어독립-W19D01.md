### Read it out loud

```
It's only a matter of time.
(그건 시간 문제일 뿐이야.)
```

You'll make it happen eventually. It's only a matter of time.

It's only a matter of time before the bakery becomes famous.

It's not about winning the competition. It's a matter of being honest.

eventually
 : 결국, 궁극적으로

honest
 : 정직한, 솔직한
