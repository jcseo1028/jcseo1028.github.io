To separate Hangul particles using the `Split` method in C#, you need to identify a pattern or delimiter that you can use to distinguish between words and particles. In Hangul (Korean script), particles are often attached directly to words, so simple delimiters like spaces may not be sufficient. Instead, you might need to use regular expressions to identify and split these particles.

Here's a basic example of how you might approach this:

1. Define the particles you want to separate.
2. Use a regular expression to match these particles and split them from the words they are attached to.

Below is a simple implementation of how to do this in C#:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string input = "안녕하세요. 저는 학생입니다.";
        
        // List of common particles (this is not exhaustive and should be adjusted as needed)
        string[] particles = { "은", "는", "이", "가", "을", "를", "와", "과", "도", "에서", "부터", "까지", "의", "으로", "로", "에게", "께", "한테", "에게서", "한테서" };
        
        // Join particles into a single pattern for regex
        string particlePattern = string.Join("|", particles);
        
        // Regex pattern to match words with optional particles
        string pattern = $@"(\w+?)({particlePattern})";
        
        // Split input based on the pattern
        var matches = Regex.Matches(input, pattern);
        
        foreach (Match match in matches)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Word: " + match.Groups[1].Value);
            Console.WriteLine("Particle: " + match.Groups[2].Value);
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:

- The `input` string contains a sentence in Korean.
- The `particles` array contains a list of common Hangul particles. You may need to adjust this list to cover all particles you want to handle.
- The `particlePattern` is created by joining the particles with the `|` operator to form a regular expression pattern.
- The `pattern` is used to match words followed by optional particles.
- The `Regex.Matches` method finds all matches in the input string based on the defined pattern.
- The code then iterates over each match, printing out the word and the particle separately.

You may need to refine the regular expression and particle list based on the specific requirements and the full range of Hangul particles you need to handle. This example provides a basic framework that you can expand upon.
